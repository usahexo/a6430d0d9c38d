In fact, American Samoa only has one professional player who has ever made it to the NFL: JD Folsom.</p>
<p>Folsom was born and raised in American Samoa and played high school football in Utah. He then played college football at Southern Utah University before being drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the seventh round of the 2004 NFL draft. He only played one season in the NFL, but he made it count. In that one season, he had two interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown.</p>
<p>Now that you know a little bit about American Samoa’s only professional player, let’s learn how to play like him!</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is learn how to tackle like an American Samoa pro. When tackling an opponent, you want to make sure you wrap your arms around them and bring them down with force. You also want to make sure you keep your head up so you can avoid hitting your head on the ground.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is learn how to run with the ball like an American Samoa pro. When running with the ball, you want to keep your head up andyour eyes focused downfield. You also want to keep your shoulders parallel with the ground so you can maintain your speed and balance.</p>
<p>Lastly, you need to learn how to block like an American Samoa pro. When blocking an opponent, you want to use your body weight to push them back. You also want to keep your head up so you can avoid getting hit in the face.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Your-Game-on-with-These-Blackjack-Tips-from-American-Samoa"><a href="#Get-Your-Game-on-with-These-Blackjack-Tips-from-American-Samoa" class="headerlink" title="Get Your Game on with These Blackjack Tips from American Samoa"></a>Get Your Game on with These Blackjack Tips from American Samoa</h1><p>In 1980, when American Samoa became a Federated State of the United States of America, the only American territory south of the equator, Blackjack was introduced to the people. With no casinos on island until 2007, playing Blackjack at home or in local pubs was and continues to be a popular pastime. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I had the great pleasure of visiting Ta’u Island in American Samoa and experiencing some of the island culture and Blackjack first-hand. Here are some tips that I learned from my experience that may help you as you enjoy this classic casino game.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Lay Down Your Best Hand First<br>When you are dealt your first two cards, always lay down your best hand first. This will give you the opportunity to improve your hand by drawing additional cards without having to worry about another player taking the card you need to improve your hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know When to Hold ‘em and When to Fold ‘em<br>This tip is just as important in Blackjack as it is in life – know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. If you have a good hand, don’t be afraid to hold onto it. But if you don’t have a strong hand, it might be wise to fold it and risk losing only half your bet rather than playing out the hand and risking losing your entire bet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Double Down for Greater Odds of Winning<br>When you double down, you are doubling your bet and agreeing to receive only one more card. This gives you greater odds of winning because it increases your chance of getting closer to 21 without going over (busting). But make sure that you have a good hand before doubling down – otherwise, you might find yourself out of money faster than you anticipated!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split Pairs for Twice the Fun (and Twice the Risk)<br>If you are dealt two cards of the same rank (e.g., two Queens), then you can split them into two separate hands by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet. This gives you twice the fun (and twice the risk) because now each hand has its own chance of winning. Just be careful not to bust by going over 21 with both hands!</p>
</li>
</ol>

The following tips will help you win big while playing this casino classic.</p>
<h1 id="1-Know-Your-Limits"><a href="#1-Know-Your-Limits" class="headerlink" title="1: Know Your Limits"></a>1: Know Your Limits</h1><p>When playing blackjack in American Samoa, it’s important to remember your limits. Don’t bet more money than you can afford to lose. This will help you stay disciplined and minimize your losses.</p>
<h1 id="2-Split-Your-Aces"><a href="#2-Split-Your-Aces" class="headerlink" title="2: Split Your Aces"></a>2: Split Your Aces</h1><p>If you are dealt two aces, always split them. This gives you two chances to win rather than one.</p>

The sound of the dice as they role, the spinning of the roulette wheel and the anticipation of whether your number is going to come up or not? If so, blackjack is one game you will definitely want to add to your repertoire. This classic card game can be enjoyed by everyone, from beginners to experts. So if you want to know how to play blackjack like a pro, read on for some tips from American Samoa!</p>
<p>The basic premise of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. The first step to becoming a pro at this game is to learn all the rules. In American Samoa, there are a few slight variations on the standard rules, so it’s important that you are familiar with these before playing. For example, in our casinos we use six decks of cards instead of two, and Aces can be counted as 1 or 11 depending on what is best for your hand.</p>
<p>Once you have familiarized yourself with the rules, it’s time to start practicing. One great way to improve your blackjack skills is by playing online. This allows you to take your time and experiment with different strategies until you find one that works best for you. Another advantage of playing online is that most sites offer free games so you can hone your skills without risking any real money.</p>
<p>In addition to practicing at home, it’s also a good idea to try out different casinos and their respective blackjack tables. Each casino has their own house rules which can vary significantly from one place to another. By playing at different venues, you will learn which rules work best for you and give yourself an edge over the house.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that blackjack is a game of strategy as well as chance. There are a number of different strategies out there but ultimately it’s up to you find one that suits your individual playing style and stick with it. With practice, patience and a little bit of luck, you too can become a pro at blackjack!</p>

In fact, as a nation we rank among the top spenders in the world on casino games. When it comes to our favorite casino game, blackjack, many people think that because the odds are better than at other table games, you don’t need any tips to win.</p>
<p>However, if you want to stack the deck in your favor when playing blackjack, consider following these tips from American Samoa:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Play at tables with fewer players. The odds are better when there are fewer players at the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid to bet big. When the dealer has a low card (2 through 6), odds are they’re going to bust. So make a big bet when this is the case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs of 10s and Aces whenever possible. This increases your chances of winning something on each hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use basic strategy charts to help guide your decisions while playing blackjack. You can find these for free online.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Stay disciplined - remember that blackjack is a game of chance, and even if you’re using perfect strategy you can still lose hands occasionally. Don’t let losing hands affect your play and ruin your chances of winning overall.</li>
</ol>
