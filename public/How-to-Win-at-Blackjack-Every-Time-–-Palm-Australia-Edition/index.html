<p>Though blackjack is a game that can be won with a bit of luck, by following some simple advice, you can tilt the odds further in your favour and make sure that you come out on top more often than not. In this article, we will go over the basics of blackjack strategy, as well as some tips that will help you to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<h2 id="The-Basics-of-Blackjack-Strategy"><a href="#The-Basics-of-Blackjack-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of Blackjack Strategy"></a>The Basics of Blackjack Strategy</h2><p>If you want to win at blackjack, it’s important that you understand the basic principles of blackjack strategy. Here are the most important things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always remember to split Aces and eights. Splitting these two cards gives you a much better chance of winning than if you were to keep them as one hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never hit on totals of 17 or higher – this is almost always a bad decision, and will usually result in you losing money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you have two cards of the same value (for example, two kings), always hit – this gives you the best chance of winning the hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the dealer has an ace showing, always take insurance – this is a good way to protect your bets against busting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these basic rules, you can give yourself a much better chance of beating the dealer and walking away with some extra cash in your pocket. However, there are also some more specific tips that can help improve your odds even further:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always try to keep track of how many decks are being used in the game – this will help you determine when to hit or stand depending on how many high cards are left in the deck. For example, if there are only three decks left in the shoe and eight high cards still remain, it’s generally advantageous to stand on totals of 12 or less.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of which hands constitute a ‘soft 17’ –this is a hand that consists of an ace and six (A6), which is considered valuable because even if the ace gets counted as one point, the total still comes up as 17. If possible, try to avoid splitting A6s, as it’s likely that you will end up with weaker hands after splitting them.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip 1: Don’t Split 10s</p>
<p>When you’re dealt two 10 cards, the temptation can be to split them and try to make two hands out of it. However, this is usually not the best move, as you’ll likely only end up with one good hand instead of two mediocre ones.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Double Down on 11</p>
<p>If you’re dealt an 11, you’ll want to double down – as this is a great opportunity to increase your chances of winning. Just make sure that the dealer doesn’t have anything higher than a 6 showing, as they’ll have a good chance of busting (going over 21).</p>
<p>Tip 3: Take Insurance When the Dealer Has an Ace</p>
<p>When the dealer has an ace up, they’ll offer players insurance – which is essentially a side bet that pays out 2-1 if the dealer ends up with a blackjack. If you believe that the dealer is likely to get blackjack, then it’s worth taking insurance – but only if you’re prepared to lose your original bet if they don’t.</p>
<h1 id="The-Top-5-Blackjack-Mistakes-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Australia"><a href="#The-Top-5-Blackjack-Mistakes-You-Need-to-Avoid-in-Australia" class="headerlink" title="The Top 5 Blackjack Mistakes You Need to Avoid in Australia"></a>The Top 5 Blackjack Mistakes You Need to Avoid in Australia</h1><p>If you’re looking to play blackjack in Australia, it’s important to be aware of the most common mistakes that players make. Here are the top 5 blackjack mistakes you need to avoid:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not Understanding the Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably the most common mistake that players make. It’s important to understand the basic rules of blackjack before you start playing. This includes understanding how the dealer works, when you can hit and stand, and what happens when you go over 21.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Playing Without a Strategy</li>
</ol>
<p>Just like any other casino game, blackjack is a game of strategy. If you don’t have a strategy, you’re likely to lose money in the long run. There are plenty of online resources and tutorials that can teach you how to play blackjack using a strategy.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Playing Too Many Hands</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes that novice players make is playing too many hands. This can lead to costly mistakes and can quickly eat into your bankroll. It’s important to play at a slow and steady pace until you’re comfortable with the game.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Not Taking Advantage of Bonuses and promotions</li>
</ol>
<p>Many online casinos offer bonuses and promotions for blackjack players. Be sure to take advantage of these offers, as they can give you a significant edge over the house. Just make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully before accepting any bonus offers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Failing to Manage Your Bankroll Properly</li>
</ol>
<p>This is another big mistake that many players make, especially those who are new to the game. It’s important to manage your bankroll properly so that you don’t lose all your money in one sitting. Decide how much money you’re willing to lose and stick to it no matter what.</p>

If you’re looking to maximize your chances of winning at blackjack in Australia, follow these tips:</p>
<p>#1 Choose a good blackjack table</p>
<p>When you’re playing blackjack in a casino, it’s important to choose a good table. Look for a table that has few players and is not crowded. This will give you more opportunities to make winning bets.</p>
<p>#2 Know the rules of blackjack</p>
<p>It’s important to know the basic rules of blackjack before you start playing. Make sure you understand how to score points, when to hit and stand, and when to double down or split cards. If you’re not familiar with the rules, ask a casino employee to explain them to you.</p>
<p>#3 Use basic strategy</p>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning at blackjack is to use basic strategy. This involves making decisions based on your hand and the dealer’s upcard. You can find basic strategy charts online or in books at the casino.</p>
<p>#4 Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose</p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes people make when gambling is betting more money than they can afford to lose. Gambling should be viewed as entertainment, not as an investment. Remember, there are no guarantees in life, especially when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>#5 Don’t drink and gamble</p>
<p>Another mistake people often make when gambling is drinking alcohol. Alcohol can impair your judgement and make it difficult to make rational decisions. It’s best to avoid drinking altogether if you want to increase your chances of winning at blackjack.</p>
