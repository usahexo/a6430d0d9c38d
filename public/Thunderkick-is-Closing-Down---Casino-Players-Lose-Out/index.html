        <h1 id="Thunderkick-is-Closing-Down-Casino-Players-Lose-Out"><a href="#Thunderkick-is-Closing-Down-Casino-Players-Lose-Out" class="headerlink" title="Thunderkick is Closing Down - Casino Players Lose Out"></a>Thunderkick is Closing Down - Casino Players Lose Out</h1><p>Thunderkick, a casino software provider, has announced it is shutting down its operations. This leaves thousands of casino players without their favourite games.</p>
<p>Thunderkick was founded in 2012 and quickly gained a reputation for developing innovative and high-quality slots games. Its portfolio includes popular titles such as Frog Grog, Esqueleto Explosivo and Magicious.</p>
<p>The company has blamed the closure on the challenging regulatory environment in the online gaming industry. It said in a statement: “After much consideration, we have come to the conclusion that the current regulatory climate in the online gaming industry is not conducive to running a sustainable business.”</p>
<p>This decision is likely to be a huge blow to Thunderkick’s customers, who are now left with no option but to seek other providers of quality slots games.</p>
<h1 id="Thunderkick-Pulls-the-Plug-on-its-Casino-Operations"><a href="#Thunderkick-Pulls-the-Plug-on-its-Casino-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Thunderkick Pulls the Plug on its Casino Operations"></a>Thunderkick Pulls the Plug on its Casino Operations</h1><p>Friday, October 12, 2018 was a sad day for the online casino industry. That’s when Thunderkick, a major player in the space, made the decision to close down its casino operations.</p>
<p>The move came as a bit of a surprise, since Thunderkick had been one of the more successful up-and-coming brands in recent years. But in a statement released on October 12, the company said that it was shutting down its casino business in order to focus on other areas of its operations.</p>
<p>“After thorough consideration, we have decided that Thunderkick’s strengths lie elsewhere than in the casino business,” the statement said. “As such, we will cease all operations related to our casinos by October 31st, 2018.”</p>
<p>This is bad news for players who were fans of Thunderkick’s games. The company had become known for its innovative and high-quality slots titles, which often featured creative themes and engaging gameplay. Some of its most popular titles include The Falcon Huntress, Barber Shop Uncut, and Esqueleto Explosivo.</p>
<p>Fortunately for these players, there are plenty of other great online casinos out there that still offer Thunderkick’s games. So they’ll still be able to enjoy some of their favorite slots titles. But it’s still sad to see a big name like Thunderkick bow out of the casino market.</p>
<h1 id="Thunderkick-Casino-Not-Good-Enough"><a href="#Thunderkick-Casino-Not-Good-Enough" class="headerlink" title="Thunderkick Casino: Not Good Enough?"></a>Thunderkick Casino: Not Good Enough?</h1><p>Thunderkick casino has been around for just a few years, but it has managed to make a big impact in the online gambling world. The site offers a wide variety of games and some of the best graphics around. But is this enough to make Thunderkick a top pick?</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>-Wide variety of games<br>-Beautiful graphics</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>-Not enough promotions or bonuses<br>-Games can be slow to load</p>
<h1 id="Why-Did-Thunderkick-Kill-its-Online-Casino"><a href="#Why-Did-Thunderkick-Kill-its-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Why Did Thunderkick Kill its Online Casino?"></a>Why Did Thunderkick Kill its Online Casino?</h1><p>When Thunderkick first burst onto the online casino scene in 2012, it was a breath of fresh air. The company offered a unique and exciting portfolio of games that set it apart from the competition.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2019 and Thunderkick is nowhere to be found. What happened?</p>
<p>The company pulled its entire portfolio from online casinos in early 2019. This move came as a surprise to many industry insiders, as Thunderkick had been one of the most successful providers in the business.</p>
<p>So why did Thunderkick kill its online casino?</p>
<p>There are several theories floating around, but no one can say for sure what prompted the decision. One possibility is that Thunderkick was feeling pressure from larger providers like Playtech and Microgaming. These companies have been around for much longer and have a deeper roster of games.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that Thunderkick was feeling squeezed by tightening regulations in the industry. Online casinos are under increasing scrutiny from governments all over the world, and this could have created an unfavorable business climate for Thunderkick.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that Thunderkick is no longer interested in the online casino market. This leaves players with fewer options when looking for quality games.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-Next-for-Thunderkick-after-Shutting-Down-its-Casino"><a href="#What’s-Next-for-Thunderkick-after-Shutting-Down-its-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What’s Next for Thunderkick after Shutting Down its Casino?"></a>What’s Next for Thunderkick after Shutting Down its Casino?</h1><p>Thunderkick, a leading supplier of casino games, announced in early 2019 that it would be winding down its casino operations. This left many industry observers wondering what the company’s next move would be.</p>
<p>In a statement announcing the move, Thunderkick said that it was pivoting its business to focus on providing games to other gaming operators. The company also said that it planned to continue developing new titles and expanding its reach into new markets.</p>
<p>So far, Thunderkick has not provided any further details about its plans. However, there are several things the company could do to capitalize on its strengths and grow its business.</p>
<p>One option is for Thunderkick to focus on growing its presence in the Asian market. The company has a strong track record in Europe, but there is potential for growth in Asia as well. Toward this end, Thunderkick could make more investments in marketing and sales efforts to tap into this market.</p>
<p>The company could also look to expand its product offering. Thunderkick is known for its quality slot games, but there is potential to offer other types of games as well. This could include table games, which are popular in Asian markets.</p>
<p>Finally, Thunderkick could look to partner with other gaming companies. This would give it access to new markets and allow it to leverage the strengths of both companies. For example, Thunderkick could provide its games to a partner company that has a strong presence in a particular region or market segment.</p>
