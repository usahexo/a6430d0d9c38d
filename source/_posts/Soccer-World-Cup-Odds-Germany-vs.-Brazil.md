#  Soccer World Cup Odds: Germany vs. Brazil

The World Cup is down to its last two teams: Germany and Brazil. The odds are in Brazil’s favor, but Germany is not to be counted out.

Odds for the World Cup Final:

Brazil -190
Germany +165
Draw +240

Brazil has made it to the final game seven times, while Germany has only done so four times. Brazil is also the defending champion, which may give them an edge. However, Germany is a formidable opponent, led by Thomas Muller, who has ten goals in this year’s tournament.

Brazil will have to be careful not to take Germany for granted. Although they are the favorites, anything can happen in a soccer match. If Brazil underestimates their opponents, they could easily lose and suffer their first World Cup defeat since 2002.
