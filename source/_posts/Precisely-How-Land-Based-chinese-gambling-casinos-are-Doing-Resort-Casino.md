#  Precisely How Land-Based chinese gambling casinos are Doing Resort Casino

The chinese language casino industry is starting to be more and more aggressive, with fresh developments in the market, most notably the opening of a number of resort casinos in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The extent to which these new venues can sway bettors from Macau and Singapore is up for debate. Nonetheless, their development underscores how mainland China’s gambling marketplace is evolving.

Whereas Hong Kong and Macau have lengthy been world-renowned for his or her casino offerings, over the last yr or so different mainland provinces have muscled into the fray. In August 2017, the $4.5 billion Dalian Lingshui Resort Casino opened in northeast China’s Liaoning province. The 12-story complex has 1,500 gaming tables and 30,000 slots.

A month later, in southwest China’s Sichuan province, the $2.5 billion Goldenaxi Chengdu Resort Casino opened its doorways. Boasting 2,000 gaming tables and 50,000 slots, the property is ready on prime of Mount Emei, one of japanese China’s Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains.

In November 2017, Yunnan province unveiled its own mammoth casino challenge. The $6 billion Lotus Land Kunming Resort has 3,000 gaming tables and 100,000 slots. Situated on the banks of Dianchi Lake – Asia’s sixth biggest freshwater lake – the complex also options resorts, theme parks and cinemas.

Whereas it is but to be seen if these new venues can wrestle market share away from established players like Hong Kong and Macau, they do underscore how mainland China’s gambling landscape is changing into increasingly sophisticated.

#  Macau overtook Las Vegas with over $33B in gambling revenue last year

Macau is a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. The main language spoken in Macau is Cantonese, which is the native language of around 58% of the population. Home to a population of just over 600,000, Macau is well known for its casinos and gambling industry.

The gambling industry has seen rapid growth in Macau in recent years, with revenue from gambling surpassing that of Las Vegas in 2018. In 2017, gambling revenue in Macau was $28.9B, while revenue from gambling in Las Vegas was $25.5B. The trend continued in 2018, with gambling revenue in Macau totaling $33.4B compared to $27.2B in Las Vegas.

The rise in gambling revenue in Macau can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, China has relaxed its stance on gambling in recent years, which has resulted in an increase in the number of Chinese tourists visiting Macau. Secondly, Macau offers more casino games than Las Vegas and has lower betting limits, making it more attractive to gamblers. Finally, Macau has been investing heavily in new casino resorts, which has drawn more tourists to the city.

The growth of the gambling industry in Macau is likely to continue into 2019 and beyond. With a growing population and increasing tourist arrivals, Macau is well placed to become the world's leading gaming destination

#  Genting Hong Kong Ltd gets approval to build casino resort in Jeju, South Korea

Genting Hong Kong Ltd, a subsidiary of Malaysian casino operator Genting Bhd, said on Wednesday it had received approval to build a casino resort worth 2 trillion won ($1.79 billion) in Jeju, South Korea.

The company plans to start construction in the second half of 2019 and open the resort in 2022, it said in a statement. It did not give further details on the project.

This is Genting Hong Kong's second major announcement this week. On Monday, it said it would spend up to $2.5 billion to develop a gaming resort in Las Vegas.

Casinos are banned in mainland China but allowed in free-trade zones such as Macau and Jeju. Genting Hong Kong is looking to tap into that demand by developing properties overseas.

Genting Hong Kong already has a casino resort complex in Jeju, which opened in December 2017 and includes a hotel, gaming facilities, an outlet mall and other amenities.

#  Chow Tai Fook Enterprises announces $2.7B investment for casino resort in Japan

On October 10, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Limited (CTFE) announced a proposed investment of US$2.7 billion for a casino resort in the city of Osaka, Japan. The deal, if finalized, would make CTFE the first foreign company to own a gaming license in Japan.

The proposed investment is part of a larger move by the Japanese government to attract more foreign tourists and stimulate economic growth. In July 2017, lawmakers passed a bill that would legalize casino gambling in the country with the goal of bringing in 20 trillion yen (US$184 billion) in revenue over the next decade.

Local and international companies have been jockeying for position in this new market, but CTFE's announcement is seen as a major coup. The company already operates casinos in Macau and Singapore, and is considered one of the world's leading gaming and hospitality firms.

The proposed casino resort will be built on Yumeshima Island, a man-made island in Osaka's bay that is currently being developed into a business district. The project is expected to create 8,000 jobs and attract 30 million visitors per year.
