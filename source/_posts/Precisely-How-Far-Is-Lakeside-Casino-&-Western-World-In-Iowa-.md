#  Precisely How Far Is Lakeside Casino & Western World In Iowa? 

Many people enjoy spending their time at the casino. Some may wonder how far the casino is from their home. The Lakeside Casino & Western World is located in Osceola, Iowa which is about 45 minutes away from Des Moines.

#  Types Of Poker Played At Lakeside Casino & Western World 

There are many different types of poker that can be found at Lakeside Casino & Western World. The most popular poker variants are Texas Hold’em, Omaha and 7-card stud, but there is also a variety of other games on offer, such as Razz, Badugi and 2-7 triple draw.

Texas Hold ’em is the most popular form of poker in the world and is played with a 52-card deck. The game is played between two players (heads up) or more typically in a six-player game. At the start of the game, each player is dealt two cards face down, which are known as hole cards. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of these cards and the five community cards that are dealt face up in the middle of the table. 

Omaha is similar to Texas Hold’em, but with a few key differences. Firstly, players are dealt four hole cards instead of two and must use exactly two of them together with three from the community cards to make their hand. Secondly, there are four rounds of betting instead of three and the fourth and final round sees a bet and a raise allowed. This makes Omaha a much more action-packed game than Texas Hold’em. 

7-card stud is one of the original poker games and is still popular today. The game is played between two or more players with seven cards each. At the beginning of each round, each player is dealt two face down cards followed by one face up card. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand using any combination of these seven cards. There are three rounds of betting: preflop, flop and turn. The final round (river) sees a bet and then a showdown where players reveal their hands to see who has won. 

Badugi is another unique poker variant that can be found at Lakeside Casino & Western World. The game uses a 52-card deck plus four jokers (wildcards). In Badugi, players are dealt four hole cards instead of two like in Texas Hold’em and Omaha. However, only one card from each hand can be used to make the final hand, so for example if you were holding A♣ 2♦ 3♥ 4♣ you would want to discard all other matching cards to make an A♥ 2♣ 3♦ 4♥ Badugi hand). There are four betting rounds: preflop, flop, turn and river. 

2-7 triple draw is also becoming increasing popular at Lakeside Casino & Western World thanks to its low house edge (the percentage taken by casino on each wager). The game uses a 52-card deck plus one joker (wildcard), which makes 53 possible hands. In 2-7 triple draw, players are first dealt five hole cards each which they must then discard down to three before the first betting round begins. Thereafter, players draw one card at a time (face up) until they have either drawn all five cards or folded (discarded their hand). The last card drawn determines your winning hand; pairs become sets, trips become trips etcetera
