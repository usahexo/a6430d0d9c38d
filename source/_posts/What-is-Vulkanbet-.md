#  Who is O'Henry?

 William Sydney Porter, better known by his pen name O'Henry, was an American writer. His short stories are often humorous and ironic in tone, expressing a keen sense of observation while examining the human condition. O'Henry is best known for his 1906 collection of short stories, "The Gift of the Magi."

# Birth and Early Life

William Sydney Porter was born on September 11, 1862, in Greensboro, North Carolina. Porter's father was a physician who died when Porter was just 12 years old. Following his father's death, Porter moved with his mother and siblings to Austin, Texas. There, Porter worked a variety of odd jobs before enrolling in medical school at the University of Texas. He soon dropped out, however, and began writing fiction instead.

# Writing Career

Porter's writing career began in earnest in 1894, when he started submitting humorous sketches to a magazine called The Rolling Stone. A year later, Porter was hired as an editor at the Houston Post. It was during this time that he began to develop the style that would make him famous—a mix of humor and irony coupled with a keen eye for detail. In 1901, Porter moved to New York City and began contributing articles to magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post and Cosmopolitan.

In 1906, Porter published his most famous work—a collection of short stories called "The Gift of the Magi." The title story is about a young couple who sell all their possessions in order to buy each other Christmas gifts. The story is renowned for its sentimental ending, which has been quoted and parodied countless times over the years.
