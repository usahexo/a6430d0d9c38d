## The Spartacus Slot Machine

The Spartacus slot machine is a five-reel, twenty payline slot machine that is based on the popular gladiator movie. The three highest paying symbols are the helmet, armor and shield symbols. Landing these symbols in any order on an active payline will payout 1000 coins. Other high paying symbols include the Colosseum and the Roman Eagle. Landing five of either of these symbols on an active payline will payout 250 coins. The Spartacus wild symbol substitutes for all other symbols except for the bonus symbol to help form winning combinations. The bonus symbol is represented by a golden chariot and landing three or more of these symbols anywhere on the reels will activate the bonus game. In the bonus game, players must choose one of six replicating shields to reveal a prize.

## Roulette Rules

There are many different variations of roulette, but the most popular version is American roulette. American roulette has 38 slots, numbered 0-36. There are 18 red slots and 18 black slots, split into two sections by a green zero slot. To play, players place their bets on where they think the ball will land after spinning around the wheel. Bets can be placed on a single number, within a column or on a row. There are also special bets that can be placed including odd or even, black or red and 1-18 or 19-36. After all players have placed their bets, the dealer spins the wheel and then drops the ball onto it. The ball will travel around the wheel before landing in one of the slots and determine which player (or house) wins their bet.
