#  What are some of the features of the game?

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing video game set in an open world environment, developed by Polish video game developer CD Projekt RED. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 19 May 2015. The game is the third in the series, preceded by The Witcher and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, which are based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s novel series “The Witcher”.

The player controls Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher. Geralt travels through the world, completing quests and fighting enemies in order to find and protect his adopted daughter Ciri from the Wild Hunt. Along the way, he makes choices that affect the course of the story. CD Projekt RED described it as “20% bigger than The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim”,[6] and promised that it would be “nothing like anything [they’ve] done before”.

# Gameplay

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt introduces several new mechanics over its predecessors. One is the addition of a new sprint button that allows Geralt to run at faster speeds for short periods of time. A witcher potion enables Geralt to slow down time for a few seconds so that he can more easily dodge enemy attacks or land critical hits; however, this ability can only be used sparingly as each potion has a limited number of charges. Geralt can now jump which will help players navigate the world and reach higher ground.[8] Finally, horseback riding was reintroduced to the series after being absent from The Witcher 2; horses serve as a fast means of transportation while also allowing players to kill enemies with melee attacks or use crossbows while mounted.[9]

Geralt collects items such as weapons, armor, food, drink and bombs, which he can use in combat or trade with merchants for other items. He must eat and drink regularly or he will suffer from various maladies including poisoning, blindness and hunger; these problems can be mitigated by eating certain foods or drinking potions. Weapons and armor can also be improved by crafting upgrades out of bought or scavenged materials. Some weapon enhancements come in the form of runes which can be applied to any weapon type; these runes add status effects such as fire damage or paralysis during combat. Similarly, armor enhancements called glyphs give bonuses such as added protection against stuns or increased damage against monsters.

Throughout his journey, Geralt encounters mini-games called Gwent which pits two teams of characters against each other in battles similar to collectible card games.[11][12][13] There are two different Gwent decks—a rare one that is automatically given to players early on,[14] and another earned by winning multiplayer matches—that have different units with varying point values. Players must weaken their opponents’ units until they can capture them using special cards called momentum cards; if the player loses three units during a round (either by having them killed or forced to discard them), they lose the match.[15] Completing Gwent quests awards players with new cards for their decks.[16] Alternatively, special character cards called hero cards can also be acquired; these are already powerful but do not have faction allegiances like most other unit cards.[17][18] Additionally, unique animated versions of some unit cards can be found scattered throughout Velen and Novigrad.[19][20][21] Cards received through Gwent may also be used in other card games played in Temeria such as those at inns.[22]
