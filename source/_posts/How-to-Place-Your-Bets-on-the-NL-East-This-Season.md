#  How to Place Your Bets on the NL East This Season

The National League East is always a hotly contested division, and this year is no exception. The Washington Nationals are the favorites to take the division crown, but theyâ€™ll have to fend off the challenge from the New York Mets, Miami Marlins, Atlanta Braves, and Philadelphia Phillies. So how do you place your bets on who will come out on top in the NL East this season?

The Washington Nationals are the clear front runners in this division. They have one of the best pitchers in baseball in Max Scherzer, an All-Star lineup led by Bryce Harper and Daniel Murphy, and one of the best managers in Dusty Baker. The Nationals went 96-66 last season and they should be able to replicate that success this year.

The New York Mets are also a strong contender in the NL East. They have a deep lineup led by Yoenis Cespedes and Jay Bruce, as well as a solid rotation anchored by Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom. The Mets were 87-75 last season and they should be able to improve on that record this year.

The Miami Marlins are another team that could contend for the division title this year. They have a young nucleus of players led by Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich, as well as a solid pitching staff headlined by Jose Fernandez. The Marlins were 79-82 last season and they should be able to improve on that record this year.

The Atlanta Braves are rebuilding but they still have some talented players on their roster, including Freddie Freeman and Ender Inciarte. They may not be contenders this year but they should be much improved over their 68-93 record from last season.

The Philadelphia Phillies are coming off of a dreadful 71-91 season but they have some talented young players on their roster, including Odubel Herrera and Aaron Nola. They may not be contenders this year but they should be much improved over their record from last season.

#  Baseball Betting Odds: NL East Edition

The National League East is home to some of the most talent-rich teams in baseball, and that means betting on NL East games can be lucrative. Let's take a look at the odds for the upcoming NL East season.

Washington Nationals: 2/1

The Nationals boast one of the most potent lineups in baseball, headlined by Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer. Led by manager Dusty Baker, Washington is a heavy favorite to win the division.

Miami Marlins: 10/1

The Marlins are coming off a disappointing season in which they finished last in the NL East. Nevertheless, they still have some talented players, including Giancarlo Stanton and Dee Gordon. If new manager Don Mattingly can get them playing to their potential, Miami could be a surprise team this year.

Atlanta Braves: 12/1

 The Braves are in rebuilding mode after trading away several stars over the past two years. However, they still have some young talent on their roster, including Freddie Freeman and Jace Peterson. Atlanta should be a decent bet for those looking for value bets this season.

New York Mets: 12/1
The Mets had high expectations last season but failed to live up to them, finishing just 79-83. This year, they'll be looking to rebound with help from new additions Yoenis Cespedes and Neil Walker. If things go well, New York could very well be the team to beat in the NL East.

Philadelphia Phillies: 20/1 

The Phillies are in the midst of a rebuild and are not expected to make much noise this season. However, they have some talented young players who could surprise everyone and make a run at the playoffs. So if you're looking for some longshot bets, Philadelphia may be worth considering.

The National League East is home to some of the most competitive teams in baseball. The Washington Nationals, Atlanta Braves, and Miami Marlins are all threats to make the playoffs, while the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets are rebuilding.

The Nationals are clear favorites to win the division, with odds of -175 at most sportsbooks. Washington is led by superstar Bryce Harper and a deep pitching staff. The Braves are next in line, with odds of +325. Atlanta has surprise MVP candidate Freddie Freeman and a solid pitching staff.

The Marlins are +700 longshots to win the division, but they could be a trendy upset pick. Led by Giancarlo Stanton, they have one of the most powerful lineups in baseball. The Phillies are +1400, while the Mets are +2000 longshots. Neither team is expected to compete for a playoff spot this season.

#  Betting the NL East Races

The NL East is up for grabs this year, with four teams all having a legitimate chance of winning the division. The Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Washington Nationals, and New York Mets are all in the hunt, and it should be a fun race to watch down the stretch.

The Phillies got off to a hot start this year and held the top spot in the division for most of the first half. But they've come back down to earth in recent weeks, and now sit just two games ahead of the Braves.

The Nationals have been one of the biggest surprises in baseball this year, as they currently sit atop the NL East standings. They've been led by their superstar duo of Max Scherzer and Bryce Harper, both of whom are playing at an MVP level.

But don't count out the Braves or Mets just yet. The Braves have been one of the most consistent teams in baseball this year, thanks largely to their starting rotation led by Mike Foltynewicz and Freddie Freeman. And the Mets have some talented young players like Jacob deGrom and Michael Conforto who could make a big impact down the stretch.

It should be an exciting finish to the NL East race, and anyone can win it. So who do you think will end up winning it?
