#  Can you guess what casino del bano High Society Game is?

Casino del bano is an online casino game that can be extremely rewarding for players who are able to achieve high scores. The premise of the game is to bet on whether a playing card will be higher or lower than a number that has already been set by the player.

The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, and each number corresponds to one of the cards in the deck. So, if you select 5 as your target, then only the 5 of clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades will be available for selection. The Ace is 1, 2 through 10 are face value, and the Jack, Queen, and King are all worth 10 points.

If you choose to bet on a higher number than the current card displayed, then your winnings will be doubled. However, if you lose your bet then you will lose your entire wager. The game continues until either the player chooses to stop or they reach their target number.

One thing that makes High Society Game unique is that it offers players the chance to gamble on multiple numbers at once. This can result in some big payouts if all of your chosen numbers come up as winners. You can also cancel any of your bets at any time by clicking on the associated minus button next to each number.
