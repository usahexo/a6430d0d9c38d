#  How to Win at Game of Thrones Slot Machine 

The slot machine game of thrones is a one armed bandit game that can be found in many casinos. The game is based on the popular HBO series and it features different bonus rounds, wilds and scatters. In this article, we will discuss how to win at game of thrones slot machine.

The first step to winning at the game of thrones slot machine is to familiarize yourself with the rules. The game has five reels and 20 paylines. Before you start playing, you need to choose your bet amount. You can bet between one and 10 coins per line. Once you have chosen your bet, you need to hit the spin button to begin the game.

The next step is to learn which symbols are associated with which bonuses. The sword and shield symbol is the wild symbol and it can substitute for any other symbol except the scatter symbol. The dragon symbol is the scatter symbol and it activates the free spins bonus round when three or more dragons appear on the reels.

In order to win the free spins bonus round, you need to get three or more dragon symbols anywhere on the reels. During the free spins bonus round, all of your wins are doubled. The best way to win big during this bonus round is to activate all of your paylines and aim for the jackpot symbols.

The other bonus round in this game is called the throne room bonus round. This bonus round is activated when you get three or more throne symbols anywhere on the reels. In order to win this bonus round, you need to choose one of four thrones. Each throne corresponds with a different prize amount. If you choose correctly, you will win that prize amount; however, if you choose incorrectly, you will lose all of your bets from that round.

In order to increase your chances of winning in this game, we recommend betting on all 20 paylines. This will give you a better chance of hitting some of the higher paying jackpot symbols. We also recommend using the wild symbol as often as possible as it can help you create winning combinations. Finally, make sure to take advantage of both bonus rounds as they offer some great prizes!

#  How to Defeat the House of Westeros Slot 

The House of Westeros slot machine is a very challenging game that can be quite frustrating for novice and even experienced players. The key to success in this game is understanding the different features and how they work.

The first step is understanding the bonuses. There are three different bonuses in the game: the Lannister, Stark, and Baratheon bonuses. The Lannister bonus is activated when three red Lannister symbols appear on the reels. This bonus pays out a fixed amount of money depending on your bet level. The Stark bonus is activated when three white Stark symbols appear on the reels. This bonus also pays out a fixed amount of money, but it is based on your total bet rather than your bet level. The Baratheon bonus is activated when three orange Baratheon symbols appear on the reels. This bonus pays out a multiplier of your total bet amount.

The next step is understanding how to use these bonuses. The Lannister and Stark bonuses are both straightforward; you just need to collect three of the same symbol to activate them. However, the Baratheon bonus can be a bit more complicated to use. In order to get the multiplier, you need to select one of five shields that will reveal your prize amount. If you don’t like what you see, you can choose again until you find a prize that you’re happy with.

The final step is actually playing the game! Once you have a good understanding of how the bonuses work, it’s time to start playing and see how much money you can win!

#  5 Tips for Beating the Game of Thrones Slot

There are a lot of popular slots games available for play, but few capture the excitement and intrigue of Game of Thrones. If you’re looking to up your game and beat the house, consider following these tips:

1. Choose Your Weapon Wisely

The first step is to choose your weapon wisely. There are a variety of different bonuses, features and wilds available in the game and it can be tempting to go all in on a single spin.

This will give you the best chance of winning big.

2. Play it Smart

Another key to success when playing Game of Thrones is to play it smart. This means knowing when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em. Don’t be afraid to walk away from a losing streak – there will always be another opportunity to win big. Likewise, don’t let your wins go to your head – remember that Lady Luck can be fickle!

3. Stay Alert

Finally, always stay alert while playing Game of Thrones slot. This means keeping an eye on the action at all times and being ready to jump on opportunities as they arise. Remember that each spin is an opportunity to win so don’t get complacent!
