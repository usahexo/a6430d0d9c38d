#  Secrets To Winning At The Buffalo Grand Slot Machine In Monaco 

The Buffalo Grand Slot Machine in Monaco is a popular game, and there are some secrets to winning at it. The first step is understanding how the game works.

The Buffalo Grand Slot Machine has five reels with 30 paylines. The goal is to match symbols on the reels to win prizes. There are three types of symbols- regular symbols, bonus symbols, and scatter symbols.

Regular symbols include playing cards from ace to nine. Bonus symbols include a golden buffalo symbol and a silver buffalo symbol. The scatter symbol is the image of Monaco itself.

To win, you need to match three or more regular symbols on a payline. The prizes depend on the symbol combinations and the size of your bet. The biggest prize is 10,000 times your bet amount for matching five silver buffalo symbols on a payline.

There are also several bonus features in the game. The first is the wild symbol. This is represented by a golden buffalo symbol and it can substitute for any other symbol to create winning combinations. It appears only on the second, third, and fourth reels.

The second bonus feature is the free spins feature. This is activated when you land three or more scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. You will then receive 10 free spins with doubled prizes. Additional free spins can be won during the free spins feature.

The third bonus feature is the gamble feature. This allows you to risk your winnings on a double or nothing gamble game. To gamble, click on the Gamble button after you have won a prize. You can then choose whether to guess whether the next card will be black or red, or whether the suit will be clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades. If you guess correctly, your prize will be doubled; if you guess incorrectly, you will lose your prize altogether.

Now that you understand how to play the game, here are some tips for winning at it:
1) Make sure you bet max lines- this will give you the best chance of winning big prizes 2) Use the wild symbol as often as possible- it can help you create lots of winning combinations 3) Take advantage of the free spins bonus- this can help boost your bankroll 4) Use the gamble feature wisely- if you feel confident about your guesses, then go for it; but if you're not sure, then don't risk it
