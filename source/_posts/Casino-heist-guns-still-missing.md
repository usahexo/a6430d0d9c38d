#  Casino heist guns still missing

Almost two years after the robbery of the Luka Bloom casino in Lima, Peru, the guns used by the assailants are still missing. The robbery, which took place on January 5, 2017, saw eight men armed with assault rifles and handguns enter the casino and make off with an as-yet unspecified amount of cash.

While most of the gunmen were able to escape following the robbery, three of their accomplices were later arrested by police. All eight have been indicted on a variety of charges related to the robbery, including aggravated robbery and using firearms in a criminal act.

In the aftermath of the robbery, investigators attempted to locate the weapons used by the gunmen but have so far been unsuccessful. It is believed that they were either abandoned or disposed of somewhere in Lima.

The Bloom casino heist was one of several high-profile robberies that took place in Peru in 2017. In December of that year, a group of masked criminals burst into a jewelry store in Lima and made off with millions of dollars' worth of watches and other items.

#  $1 Million in casino heist guns still unaccounted for

The FBI is still searching for weapons stolen in a million-dollar casino heist in Las Vegas, more than a year after the robbery occurred.

The thieves made off with 23 firearms, including 14 semi-automatic rifles, during the October 2017 robbery at the Cosmopolitan hotel.

Authorities have said they believe the weapons are now in the hands of a criminal organization and could be used in crimes such as homicide or terrorism.

"These are not just any firearms," said Jill Snyder, Special Agent in Charge of the San Francisco Field Office. "They are high-powered, semi-automatic rifles that can do a lot of damage."

Snyder added that she was confident the FBI would find the weapons, but admitted it was possible they may never be recovered.

In addition to the firearms, the thieves also made off with $162,000 in cash from the casino's vault.

#  Police puzzled over where guns from casino heist are

The theft of firearms from a casino in the Philippines has puzzled police after they discovered the guns have not been used in any crime since the robbery.

On New Year's Day, a group of masked gunmen stole nearly 60 firearms from a casino in Manila, capital of the Philippines. The weapons included revolvers, pistols, and sniper rifles. Police say the weapons are valued at around $180,000.

Since the robbery, however, none of the stolen guns have been used in any crimes. This has left police wondering where the guns are and who stole them.

Casino security footage of the robbery showed that the gunmen were highly skilled and well-prepared. They wore masks to hide their identities and were armed with assault rifles, handguns, and fragmentation grenades.

They entered the casino through a loading dock and made their way to a room where the firearms were stored. After threatening employees with violence, they stole the guns and fled the scene.

Casino staff have said that they were not able to get a good look at the robbers' faces and were not able to provide any clues as to their identities.

Police have released images of the stolen firearms in an effort to identify them. So far there have been no leads as to who stole them or where they might be hiding.

#  Guns used in casino heist still not found

The guns used in the casino heist where still not found. The police have been investigating the case for weeks, but they have not been able to find any clues that could lead them to the perpetrators.

The robbery happened a few weeks ago and it was one of the most daring robberies in recent history. The thieves managed to get away with millions of dollars worth of cash and casino chips.

The police have released pictures of the suspects and they are asking for the public’s help in identifying them. However, no one has come forward with any information about their identities.

The casino heist has generated a lot of speculation among the general public. Some people believe that the perpetrators are professional criminals and that they have planned this robbery for months. Others think that it might be an inside job, and that someone from the casino is involved.

The police are still investigating all these leads, but they have not been able to confirm any of them yet. They are asking anyone with information about the robbery to come forward and contact them immediately.

#  Criminals may have already smuggled casino heist guns out of the country

Investigators probing the casino heist in Pahrump, Nevada believe that some of the firearms used in the robbery may have been smuggled out of the country. They are asking for the public’s help in locating these guns.

So far, no arrests have been made in connection with the robbery. However, investigators believe that a group of criminals from California carried out the heist. The suspects are believed to have ties to several known gangs in Los Angeles.

The weapons used in the robbery were a mix of handguns and long guns. None of the firearms have yet been recovered, but investigators believe that they may have been smuggled across the border into Mexico.

It is unclear how many of the guns involved in the robbery are still at large, but authorities are urging anyone who may have information about their whereabouts to come forward. The suspects could be armed and dangerous, so it is important to take any potential threats seriously.
